# Machine_Learning_NYC_Taxi_Trip

Project: Building Basic predictive models over the NYC Taxi Trip dataset. 

We are provided with the NYC Taxi Trip Dataset. This dataset contains information about the taxi trips that took place in different parts of New York City and how much time did that trip take to complete.
In this project, the following are the tasks we have to complete: 
1. Choosing the most suitable evaluation metric and stating why we choosed it. 
2. Building a benchmark model for the given dataset. 
3. Building a K-Nearest neighbours model for the given dataset and find the best value of K. 
4. Building a Linear model for the given dataset with regularisation. Interpreting the variable coefficients of the Linear Model. 
5. Building a Decision tree model for the given dataset. Interpreting the variable importance. 
6. Plotting the following Barplots: 
    a. train score of all the above models. 
    b. test score of all the above models. 
    c. Attempt to explain the observations from the plots.
